My COMP1004 Project by Nando Dos Ramos

<h3>Title: Scientific Calculator</h3>

<h3>Project Vision:</h3>
My project vision is to create a simple to use scientific calculator with a variety of functional use. To be as accessible as possible, I also want for this calculator to have a responsive layout and change depending on the dimensions of the screen it's displayed on.
I aim for this calculator to perform numeracy conversions between Denary, Binary, Octal & Hexadecimal, as well as be able to perform mathematics to an A-level standard. It'll also include useful mathematical functions, such as trigonometry.
